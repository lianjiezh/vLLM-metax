# Contributing to plugin

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `vllm-metax`! 

Before writing the first line of codes, we strongly recommand you to take a look at plugin architechture and design principle. Here is a quick guide for them:

- [Introduction of plugin system](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/design/plugin_system.html)
- [[RFC]: Hardware pluggable](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/11162)
- [[RFC]: Enhancing vLLM Plugin Architecture](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/19161)

!!! Note
    If you want to develop or debug vllm-metax plugin, you may need to build and install the plugin from source.
    Currently we recommanded you to start from existed docker images on [*MetaX Develop Community*](https://developer.metax-tech.com/softnova/docker) and following the [**MACA**](../getting_started/installation/maca.md) installation guide.
